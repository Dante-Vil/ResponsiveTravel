          <h3>Tahiti's legendary rock at Point Tata</h3>
          <p class="tahitiLegendPar">Long ago, cheifs came and scattered feathers in an ancient ritual that would determine a person's destiny. The way the feathers fell determined if that person could enter Rohutu Noanoa (a.k.a the “Gateway to Paradise”). Rohutu Noanoa was believed to be a place of supreme perfection with water that sparkled like diamonds and an abundance of fish. If that person was allowed entrance, when they died they would turn into a bird and fly away to paradise -- but if not, they became a slave and lived forever in darkness.</p>
